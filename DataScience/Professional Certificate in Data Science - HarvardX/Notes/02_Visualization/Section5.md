**SECTION 5** 
* adapt and optimize visuals for audience
* difference in length is easier to see than difference in angle
* include 0 in plot when plotting length (not position)
* graph proportional area over radius
* geom_jitter()
* keep axes same when comparing data across plots
* align plot vertical vs horizontal
* consider transformations on axes or data
* plot multiple variables on same graph with different shapes

Key Terms
* position
* aligned lengths
* angles

* slope chart (with geom_line)
* bland altman plot
* sequential vs divergent (colors quantifying a numeric var)
* avoid 3d plots
* Ordinal (named categorical)
* Non Ordinal (ranks categorical)

R
